# Satya's Homework 4 - Dynamic Calling Cards - navigation prototypes

This is homework assignment #4 for CMSC475, where I had to create a working prototype in Figma of the navigation elements I will have for my 5 panels, the dynamic calling card.

You can find the report, both the QMD and HTML files in the report folder, also inside the report folder is the assets folder which holds the pictures of my frames and any other PNG files

The report shows my 5 Figma panels as PNGs with thorough descriptions of my navigation strategy and elements for the user to go through the 5 panels. 

The report also includes the working prototype as an iframe, you can click it, use arrow keys, number keys, etc. and it will all work to navigate.
